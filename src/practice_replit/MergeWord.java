/*
Use String methods and if statements to combine the two given String variables, word1 and word2 together,
 but only combine them if the Strings are only three character long.
 If either String is not three characters long, do not merge them together and instead print cannot merge.
  If both Strings are three characters long then merge them together in the following format and print
  the merged String:
The Strings will be merged by taking the first character of the first word, then the first character
 of the second word, then the second character of the first word, etc...
Hint: Concatenating any type with a String, converts the type to a String
Ex:
  Input:
    aok
    lol
  Output:
    alookl

Ex:
  Input:
    ear
    pie
  Output:
    epaire

Ex:
  Input:
    java
    wow
  Output:
    cannot merge
